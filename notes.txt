Save current files in a config_session_file
Load current files from config_session_file (or config_session_file_initial if it doesn't exist)


If no .geany/, offer to create one

If no .geany/, recurse upwards until {find a .git folder}
If .geany found, load a project.ini file (might be added to git)
If .geany found, load a session.ini file (probably not added to git)
Session stores open files
Session stores open leaves in project tree
Save session on close?
Save project on close?

Ask about .geany path : GtkWidget* ui_path_box_new	(	const gchar * 	title, GtkFileChooserAction 	action, GtkEntry * 	entry )		

Load session_default.ini file if it's in .geany and no session.ini exists

Goto correct line upon session load  : gboolean 	editor_goto_pos (GeanyEditor *editor, gint pos, gboolean mark)
geany initial path : GeanyDocument * 	document_get_current (void)
