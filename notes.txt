yum install geany

yum install pygtk2 pygtk2-devel
#yum install glade  ## No need - we're doing this with raw GTK

## yum install PyYAML  ## No need - ConfigParser is in standard libraries

cd {project-tree main directory itself from git}
ln -s `pwd`/project-tree ~/.config/geany/plugins/geanypy/plugins/

ToDos :

DONE  Need to detect whether start directory contains a .geany/ folder
DONE  Load project_sample.ini file if it's in .geany
DONE  Double-1-Click on a group to open/close branch
DONE  Double-1-Click on a file to open it in editor (row-activated)

DONE  1-Click on file == just change selection (== noop in signal handler)
DONE  1-Click on path == just change selection (== noop in signal handler)

DONE  Drag-and-Drop for files and groups
DONE  Save current layout in a config_tree_layout_file

DONE  Auto menubar populator from annotated class.method names
DONE  Auto popup populator from annotated class.method names

DONE  3-Click : Add new group 'here'
DONE  3-Click : Rename this entry (group or file)
DONE  3-Click : Add current file 'here'
DONE  3-Click : Delete this entry (group or file)

DONE  Relative filenames should be w.r.t directory in which .geany lives
DONE  Relative filenames should be correct.
DONE  AddGroup dialog should have OK button as default action

DONE  If no .geany/, offer to create one
DONE  Ask about .geany path : GtkWidget* ui_path_box_new	(	const gchar * 	title, GtkFileChooserAction 	action, GtkEntry * 	entry )		
DONE  If .geany found, load a project.ini file (this file is "stable" enough for a user to want to add to git)
DONE  Option to Load project tree from a chosen .ini (if the .geany folder doesn't exist, for instance)
DONE  Option to Load project tree from scitepm.xml file

DONE  Session stores open files
DONE  Save current files in a config_session_file
DONE  If .geany found, load a session.ini file (probably not added to git)
DONE  Load current files from config_session_file (or config_session_file_initial if it doesn't exist)

If there's no current project-tree-base-directory, then how do we do relative files??
May be best to guess the current base directory upon initial loading (or loading of a specific file)

Create a suitable README.rst
Split off this twig from 'sketchpad' git repo
Prepare github for receiving 'geany-project-tree' repo
Upload repo
Check README.rst and revisions work cleanly
Announce on geany-plugin-devel


Goto correct line upon session load  : gboolean 	editor_goto_pos (GeanyEditor *editor, gint pos, gboolean mark)

If no .geany/, recurse upwards until {find a .git folder}

Session stores open leaves in project tree

Save session on close?
Save project on close? :: Not clear whether there's a suitable signal handle to latch onto
